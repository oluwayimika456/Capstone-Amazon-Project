# Capstone-Amazon-Project

This project is a capstone data analysis task focused on extracting insights from an Amazon product dataset. It involves data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and business interpretation using Excel tools like PivotTables, formulas, and dashboards.

##  Objective
To explore and analyze Amazon product listings, focusing on:
- Discount patterns
- Customer ratings and reviews
- Revenue opportunities
- Product pricing segmentation
- Category-level insights

##  Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (PivotTables, Slicers, Charts, Formulas)
- Word (for insights summary)

##  Key Business Questions Answered
1. What are the top categories by potential revenue?
2. Which categories offer the highest average discount?
3. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?
4. What’s the relationship between discount and rating?
5. What are the top 5 products by combined rating and review score?
6. What price range has the highest number of products?
7. How are products distributed across categories and price points?
...e.t.c.

##  Key Insights
- **Electronics** and **Home & Kitchen** drive the highest potential revenue.
- A **moderate discount** does not strongly influence customer ratings.
- **Mid-range priced products (₹200–₹500)** are the most common.
- Some categories are deeply discounted, which may affect perception.
- Top-rated products also have a high volume of reviews — strong brand trust.
